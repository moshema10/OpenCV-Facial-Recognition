# OpenCV-Facial-Recognition

## About The Project

The OpenCV-Facial-Recognition project provides a way to check for blacklisted people in a directory of images using facial recognition. It uses OpenCV to check for faces within images and compares these detected faces against a pre-defined list of blacklisted images based on their facial histograms. The core functionality includes loading images, detecting face regions, computing face histograms for detailed comparison and identifying matches within faces.
